It has been seven years since the London bombings of 7/7, one of the worst terrorist atrocities in recent British history.

Each of them believes a different conspiracy theory - from claiming the train times were falsified by the government to the idea that home-made bombs could never have caused such damage. They talk to eyewitnesses, families of victims, government officials and specialists to uncover the truth about what happened that day.

For some of the UK's biggest companies, paying corporation tax seems to be optional. Using devilishly complicated - but completely legal - accounting techniques, they can run rings around HMRC. Now, the small businesses of one Welsh town are fighting back. The local traders of Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons are embarking on a mission to copy the techniques used by their multinational rivals, and to set up a DIY tax avoidance scheme of their very own.

Presented by Heydon Prowse, co-presenter of BBC Three's The Revolution Will Be Televised, this film follows the owner of the local coffee shop, clothing stores, smokery, optician and bookshop of on their offshore mission. It is a journey that will take them to secretive tax havens, smart tax lawyers and even force a showdown with the taxman himself. Can they crack the secrets of the big tax avoiders and level the playing field for the small guy?

When David Chen detained a thief at the Lucky Moose Food Market in Chinatown, the Toronto shopkeeper did not expect to be the one arrested.

In May 2009, Chen performed a citizen’s arrest on a brazen thief who had repeatedly stolen plants (and only plants) from local shops.

To David’s great surprise, he was the one arrested when police arrived — not the shoplifter. David and his colleagues faced serious charges, with a possible penalty of up to two years in jail.

They challenged those charges in court, but that’s not all: Chen and his legal team engaged Parliament to challenge the way the Canada’s citizen’s arrest laws were written. 

The results would not only change David Chen's life, but also Canada's Criminal Code.

Russia is the largest country on earth and home to nearly 150 million people. Vladimir Putin is well into his third term as president and with the west imposing tough sanctions, relations are now the frostiest since the Cold War.

Reggie Yates gets up close and personal with three very different communities in contemporary Russia. By living with them for a week, he explores what it's like for young people living here, 24 years after the fall of the Soviet Union.

An army of Siberian models is invading the west. Siberia is known around the world for its frigid temperatures, but within the fashion world it is famous for being home to the world's most beautiful women. Reggie joins international scouts as they board the Trans-Siberian railway and cross Siberia looking for the freshest new faces.

At the open castings - the first one in Krasnoyarsk, 2,800km east of Moscow - Reggie meets girls as young as 13 as they parade in bikinis, hoping that their stunning looks will get them noticed. In Novosibirsk, Siberia's capital, he visits some of the city's 26 modelling agencies and schools, where children as young as five are learning how to walk, pose, apply make-up, and diet.

He meets Anya, who would love to be an artist but realistically knows that, here in Siberia, there's more chance of her making money as a model, Vika, who has been eating buckwheat for breakfast, lunch and dinner in a bid to lose those extra two centimetres for the casting, and Katia, whose parents are distraught when they have to make a decision about whether she goes to work in China - at the age of just 15.

But how likely is it that they will really succeed? What are the pitfalls of the modelling industry? And what is the life they are leaving behind like?

Shot in stunning 4K and narrated by the 2018 Emmy® Award-winning actor Matthew Rhys, this compelling series explores six of the world’s most iconic walls and borders. It features the wall between the US and Mexico, the Korean DMZ, the Israel-Palestine Separation Barrier, the walled communities in Northern Ireland, Cyprus’ Green Line, and the now-demolished Berlin Wall.

From the crumbling ruins of ancient walls to brick barriers that are currently under construction, each episode uncovers the human stories behind these walls and asks why they were built, how they affect people’s lives, and what happens when the walls come down. This is a series about hope and unity in the face of division and about the triumph of the human spirit in spite of separation.

[Released In 2018]

They start at the top, working for Shahi Enterprises in New Delhi, a multi-million pound factory that makes clothes for some of the biggest UK high street names. They learn to sew before joining the production lines where every worker has targets to meet. Supervisors patrol the lines and, at lunch, the sexes are made to sit apart. As unskilled workers they're paid around one pound fifty a day, a basic living wage in India.

It is established by the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement to serve as a buffer zone between North Korea and South Korea. 

Shot in stunning 4K and narrated by the 2018 Emmy® Award-winning actor Matthew Rhys, this compelling series explores six of the world’s most iconic walls and borders. It features the wall between the US and Mexico, the Korean DMZ, the Israel-Palestine Separation Barrier, the walled communities in Northern Ireland, Cyprus’ Green Line, and the now-demolished Berlin Wall.

From the crumbling ruins of ancient walls to brick barriers that are currently under construction, each episode uncovers the human stories behind these walls and asks why they were built, how they affect people’s lives, and what happens when the walls come down. This is a series about hope and unity in the face of division and about the triumph of the human spirit in spite of separation.

[Released In 2018]

When adults are ineffectual, children have to grow up quickly. Ola is 14 and she takes care of her dysfunctional father, autistic brother, and a mother who lives separately; but most of all she tries to reunite the family. She lives in the hope of bringing her mother back home. Her 13-year-old brother Nikodem’s Holy Communion is a pretext for the family to meet up. Ola is entirely responsible for preparing the perfect family celebration.

Communion reveals the beauty of the rejected, the strength of the weak and the need for change when change seems impossible. This crash course in growing up teaches us that no failure is final. Especially when love is in question

Hosted by Australia's star mathematics teacher, Eddie Woo, follow 15 teenagers from across Australia, as they take charge of the family budget.

Host and buoyant mathematician Eddie Woo challenges 13 year old Vasanth to budget frugally for his mother Sathya, dad Shan and bigger brothers Ananth & Jayanh. For the next month the youngest in this Indian-Australian family is in charge of the decisions and $3850 in cold, hard cash.
But with great power comes great responsibility. All Vasanth wants to do is upgrade his scooter. If he had his way there were be scooter parks every 2 km and no more cars. Sounds good to me.
If he is to get that scooter upgrade he will have to save some costs, but will it mean fewer family take-aways, less money on entertainment & outings and cuts to the groceries? 

The big question: is there enough left in the case to upgrade that scooter?

Nine teenage tearaways from Manchester are trained to become beauty queens, with one being chosen to represent England in the Miss Teen International competition in America. Former pageant winner Michelle Fryatt dispenses advice, soon finds her pupils are not as eager to learn as she had hoped

The girls were transformed into beauty queens - in just six weeks. Out went the tracksuits and bad language. In came poise, new life skills - and posh frocks. One went on to represent England in the biggest teen pageant in America - Miss Teen International - and most had their lives changed.

Many have risked their lives to cross South Africa’s borders, and in their desperation resort to the only accommodation they can afford: the slum buildings of the inner city of Johannesburg. The slum buildings are vertical squatter camps – far more dangerous, far more overcrowded, where the fight for survival is brutal and unrelenting. Many of the buildings are hijacked; some are run by slumlords that demand rent from tenants, despite the fact that there is no water or electricity in the buildings. Many of those who cross South Africa’s borders enter the country illegally, carrying the little they own, and often without any form of documentation. They fear deportation and police brutality, and many speak of corrupt home-affairs officials to whom they must pay bribes to apply for asylum or refugee status.

The subject is one I constantly wrestle with. How can we best teach values and decency between our fellow man? Through compassion or punishment? I guess it's clear what I was thinking would be best in the events depicted in the film.

As their first year draws to a close the 3 Nigerian fathers continue their roller coaster ride of faith, dedication and culture shock.

The Mission, is a four-part documentary series by the team who produced the extremely popular series The Abbey for Compass. The Mission is the story of missionaries in reverse, as three young Nigerian Catholic priests, who haven’t volunteered, who have never left Africa before, are sent to save Tasmania’s struggling Church.

Epic voyages revealed myriad cultures, thousands of miles of harsh terrain, and eventually, the southernmost tip of the continent--the Cape of Storms.

The Namib Desert flowing into the Atlantic is an eerily beautiful sight--one of many in Beyond the Cape of Storms. This stunningly executed historical documentary-travelogue traces Portuguese seafaring exploration of the uncharted African coastline during the last half of the 15th century. The video--the second in a four-volume series--combines citations from original travel logs, rare maps and illustrations, architectural sites, interviews with historians, and vivid film footage shot both on land and at sea. Footage from both restored and modern vessels reveals areas of coastline that look the same now as they must have half a millennium ago. The video also contains spectacular inland footage of the different provisioning locales. In each of these, local historians trace their communities' history from the first Portuguese contact through the devastating era of slave deportations to the modern day. The result is a fascinating study of a critical era in maritime history and simultaneously an outstanding travelogue of coastal Ghana, Príncipe, São Tomé, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Angola, Namibia, and South Africa.

v6etqOMx8sc,UCr5qeBG9g7bGtMGyHG2GzbQ,[],PT28M20S,27,Why The Public Never Really Liked Prince Albert | Royal Upstairs Downstairs | Absolute History,"Antiques expert Tim Wonnacott and chef Rosemary Shrager visit Belvoir Castle in Rutland following in the footsteps of Queen Victoria, who visited here in 1843. She was 24, had been married for nearly four years and already had three children.

Tim reveals that, when Victoria and Albert came to Belvoir, Albert's popularity rating was pretty low. Although Victoria adored him, he wasn't really liked by the public or the upper classes. So Victoria's advisers - the spin doctors of the day - thought that the sight of a handsome man on horseback, hunting heroically with the famous Belvoir hunt, might help boost his image. 

With chef and food historian Ivan Day, Rosemary cooks a dish that would have been cooked for the whopping 1,000 people the Duke invited for dinner over the course of the three-day royal visit, hunter's beef: a hearty brisket that takes 16 days to cure. They prepare the food in the magnficent kitchen at Belvoir that is just as it would have been during HRH's stay.

Autistic savant Stephen Wiltshire has the ability to sketch huge urban landscapes from memory in near-photographic detail. This documentary tells the story of the boy who stunned the world with his first picture of Salisbury Cathedral at the age of eight, and who has developed into a successful young artist. Stephen has drawn many of the world’s greatest cities such as Rome, New York, and Hong Kong; yet he has never drawn his home town. Spending 15 minutes taking in the London skyline from a helicopter, Stephen will then be provided with a 360-degree, 20-meter wide canvas and a box of pens and pencils to sketch the view from memory, street-by-street, and building for building.
This film will follow Stephen as he faces his greatest challenge yet – to draw the largest ever panoramic view of London to be put on public display.

But what if you are also an Australian born Royal Princess and expected to supervise complex Hindu traditions stretching back centuries?

As the first non Balinese Royal bride, Princess Asri is also the buffer between her daughter-in-law to be and the rest of the Royal family, uncomfortable with the fact that the groom, Asri’s ‘Indo-Aussie’ son Max, is marrying a famous Indonesian actress, Happy Salma. And Happy’s Muslim family are none too happy about her marrying a Hindu, prince or not…

With unique access to this extraordinary Royal Wedding, the audience travels deep into the heart of the little-known world of Balinese Hinduism as it smacks up against 21st century cross-cultural religious divide. Enter into a world of pomp and ceremony, obligations, strictly defined roles, business interests, politics and intrigue…

Real Love dives into the world of love, dating and relationships in all its many shapes. Whether you like documentaries, reality TV shows, or classic films, Real Love delivers your weekly dose of snuggles and affection.

ZdNA-H45QzE,UCq-v1_6XaAQm_ar6Flsgwpg,[],PT58M25S,24,"""Your Hands Are So Flappy, Like Noodles!"" | Love and Sex in China | Real Love","With an estimated 180 million singletons in China and people traditionally marrying early, the race to find a soulmate before surpassing their sell by date is frantic. Singles fairs, where CVs are passed around, speed-dating and lessons in the art of seduction are all examples of a booming westernised market. But there is a massive imbalance in the sexes due to the penchant for male offspring since the single-child policy was introduced in 1980. Future brides are in short supply and the men most likely to find a wife are those in a strong financial position.

With the economic liberalisation of China and the rise of the wealthy businessman, an ancient tradition has resurged: the concubine. Young women, often students from poorer families, seek positions as mistresses at the beck and call of wealthy men. Hidden away in lavish apartments and given large sums of pocket money, they enjoy a life of ease and luxury. The wives of these men have gone to drastic measures to unveil their fickle husbands’ crimes. We take a ride with private detectives and meet the one dubbed, ’The Concubine Killer’.

This dramatised documentary series is based upon a collection of letters left by Casanova in the library of Duchov Palace where he died at the age of 73, all but forgotten by a world that he had charmed, amazed and shocked only a few years before.

The letters were catalogued by Bernhard Marr in 1913, but with the outbreak of World War I, were again forgotten and never commercially published, available only as tools to researchers. These documents are actual correspondence between Casanova and his lovers, offering a completely  unique perspective to his story.

A true son of the renaissance, Casanova was a musician, a cleric, a spy and a lover. He led a tempestuous life where he amassed and lost fortunes, invented the National Lottery, fought duels with Counts, and had the most famous love life of all time.

This dramatised documentary series is based upon a collection of letters left by Casanova in the library of Duchov Palace where he died at the age of 73. The letters were catalogued by Bernhard Marr in 1913, but with the outbreak of World War I, were again forgotten and never commercially published, available only as tools to researchers. These documents are actual correspondence between Casanova and his lovers, offering a completely unique perspective to his story.

Maybe you make a career of it. Now, whether you are a Wall Street novice or a blue-chip expert, you can fall victim to a fraud that is called ""pump and dump"". This scam is so named because the fraudster would artificially pup up the stock's value with false claims, unrealistic projections, maybe even a couple of phoney news stories, and then dump his share when the value is high. Unfortunately for you and the other investors, the stock soon plummets and investors' money is lost forever.

With so many ways to access information nowadays, it's important to be alert and to be able to identify a scam from reality is a must.

From a spectacular Hollywood premiere, to a star-studded Emmy's after party, Celebrity RSVP gives the television viewers an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create and produce some of the most illustrious social events and parties in Hollywood and around the world. 

Each year (since 1971) in late May, the city hosts the annual Police-Celebrity Golf Tournament, billed as ""the world's largest celebrity-supported sports charity event,"" where Hollywood stars and members of the Los Angeles Police Department join forces to raise money for charity (injured LAPD officers and their families).

In 2006, the host was Mark Wahlberg (""The Perfect Storm"", ""Three Kings"", ""Boogie Nights""). Other participants included Rob Morrow (""Northern Exposure"", ""Numb3rs"", Joe Pesci (the ""Lethal Weapon"" films), Chris O'Donnell (""Batman & Robin""), Chad Everett (""Medical Center""), Ron Masak (""Murder She Wrote""), Joe Mantegna (""Joan of Arcadia""), Anne-Marie Johnson (""In the Heat of the Night""), Tyler Mane (""X-Men""), Will Wheaton (""Star Trek - TNG""), C. Thomas Howell (""The Outsiders""), Scott Patterson ('Luke' on ""Gilmore Girls""), baseball great Jose Canseco, Rogie Vachon (L.A. Kings), and many others.

Each episode follows one world-renowned event planner as they design, organise and finally present one spectacular high-profile event.

In exchange for an interest-free mortgage on a brand new house Paul Brandt is asking mother Jibeko to help build homes for the less fortunate in Mexico and offer 500 hours of her time helping other ""build it forward projects"". 

Nearly 900 million people currently live in poverty around the globe and this number is estimated to reach 1.6 billion (one-fifth of the world’s population) by the year 2025.

They have bounced around to different homes with most of them too small, unfinished, and even lacking hot water and heating. In exchange for an interest-free mortgage on a brand new house in Alberta Canada, Paul is asking Jaylene to help build homes for the less fortunate in Mexico and improve living conditions in a developing country. This NEW Abode series is dedicated to a very real issue, poverty. 

Nearly 900 million people currently live in poverty around the globe and this number is estimated to reach 1.6 billion (one-fifth of the world’s population) by the year 2025. The need for adequate living standards for most people living in third world countries is a great one. With an exponential growth rate and a general lack of modern infrastructure, these countries continue to suffer.

In exchange for an interest-free mortgage on a brand new house in Alberta Canada, Paul is asking Jaylene to help build homes for the less fortunate in Mexico and improve living conditions in a developing country. This NEW Abode series is dedicated to a very real issue, poverty. 

Nearly 900 million people currently live in poverty around the globe and this number is estimated to reach 1.6 billion (one-fifth of the world’s population) by the year 2025. The need for adequate living standards for most people living in third world countries is a great one. With an exponential growth rate and a general lack of modern infrastructure, these countries continue to suffer. Paul Brandt's Build It Forward movement is aiming to help as many people as possible who are struggling with their living conditions.

After years of struggling in the kitchen where she has created such delicacies as pasta bathed in ketchup and poached chicken breasts in water sauce, fish, Olena wants to expand beyond her key ingredient; water. With her son on the cusp of flying the proverbial coop, Olena’s biggest fear is that he will never want to come home from university if she only has “bad food” to serve. After Olena annihilates fried chicken, she churns up some old memories of her mother when she learns how to make butter Black Creek Pioneer Village style. She also learns how to bake cream cheese biscuits which profits her when she attempts to make chocolate profiteroles for patrons at a high-end restaurant. From kooky to culinary Christine has a lot to tackle as she attempts to teach this martial arts instructor a cooking move or two.

After years of struggling in the kitchen where she has created such delicacies as pasta bathed in ketchup and poached chicken breasts in water sauce, fish, Olena wants to expand beyond her key ingredient; water. With her son on the cusp of flying the proverbial coop, Olena’s biggest fear is that he will never want to come home from university if she only has “bad food” to serve. After Olena annihilates fried chicken, she churns up some old memories of her mother when she learns how to make butter Black Creek Pioneer Village style. She also learns how to bake cream cheese biscuits which profits her when she attempts to make chocolate profiteroles for patrons at a high-end restaurant. From kooky to culinary Christine has a lot to tackle as she attempts to teach this martial arts instructor a cooking move or two.

From fried cucumbers to flash fires, Anna has been banned from cooking more times than she can count. Thankfully, up until now, Anna has been able to rely on Sasha, her culinary student kid sister who was clearly the one who inherited their ex-restaurateur grandmother’s gastronomic prowess. After Anna struggles with an old family classic, potato pancakes, she's off to the butcher to take a stab at making bison burgers from scratch. Anna then has to stuff her fears in her back pocket when it's time to stuff peppers with Christine, and finally it's out of the paella pan and into the fire to impress some VIP's at a Spanish wine tasting event. Anna may be fearless about a lot of things, but it’s going to take a huge leap of faith for Christine to put the fight into Anna’s cooking plight.

From mustard to honey BBQ sauce there isn’t a half filled bottle of sauce in her fridge that Carlie has not employed at one time or another. Carlie really wants to learn how to properly prepare meat so she can host a dinner party that doesn’t end up with firemen as unexpected guests. Carlie grows from creating cookie chaos to finding out the process of smoking the ribs she has won contests eating. She also learns how to properly prepare pork chops and finds herself in a heated situation when she attempts to make ice cream for a huge culinary event.

Marty is no fan of pantomime, or of Christmas in general, and plans to head off for some winter sun - preferably to a country where carol-singing is punishable by death.

Meanwhile Sam is busy baking some mince pies for Ben. Rick thinks his daughter is being sweetly old fashioned until Marty points out that the pies may contain a certain special ingredient. Michael, the deranged local café owner has his own reasons for looking forward to Christmas. To everyone's amazement, he has finally found a girlfriend.

Only Magda fails to get into the Christmas spirit. She is officially in mourning, as the President of her country has died. As Rick points out, at least it means he'll avoid the war crimes trial.

As the countdown to Christmas begins, the problems stack up for Rick. The bargain tree that he bought is losing its needles. It looks like Magda is going to be joining them for Christmas dinner. And when Rick accidentally injures an old lady, there's a very unseasonal confrontation with his neighbour Clive. It soon turns into a Christmas that Rick will never forget - for all the wrong reasons.

Sue and Noel Radford have 16 kids already and they aren't stopping there. The couple were both given up for adoption at birth and due to their neglected childhoods wanted a big family. Sue first fell pregnant with Chris at just 14 in 1989 and was determined to keep the baby. She married Noel four years later - and they were soon expecting their second child Sophie. From then onwards she gave birth to a new child every year for over a decade. But as they try for number 17 there are complications and the family is faced with some life-changing news.

Pure O stands for 'purely obsessional'. People sometimes use this phrase to describe a type of OCD where they experience distressing intrusive thoughts but there are no external signs of compulsions. Pure O is sometimes mistakenly seen as a “less severe” form of OCD, yet those who experience symptoms of this disorder find that the characteristic intrusive thoughts can be very disruptive and distressing.

These terrorists intentionally flew two jet airliners into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York City and a third aircraft into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. A fourth aircraft, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into an open field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. The flight data that was recovered from the crash site revealed that the terrorists had reprogrammed the aircraft's autopilot system to Washington, D.C. most likely crash into the United States Capitol Building. 

This Absolute Documentary is an accurate reconstruction based upon the airline's tape recordings from air traffic control and telephone communications. What happened that day onboard Flight 93? 

Flight 93 was delayed more than 25 minutes due to typically heavy morning traffic. Just four minutes after Flight 93 departed, hijacked Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center. At 9:03 a.m., a second hijacked plane, Flight 175, hit the South Tower. Flight 93 crashed only 20 minutes flying time from Washington, D.C because of the quick and determined actions of the passengers and crew. Flight 93 was the only one of the four hijacked aircraft that failed to reach the terrorists' intended target that day. The passengers and crew showed unity, courage, and defiance in the face of adversity.

Food banks are facing unprecedented demand, and homeless shelters now have long waiting lists, as families who have known a much better life have to leave their homes, sometimes with just a few day's notice. In this documentary, we meet three children whose families are struggling to get by and asks them to tell us what life in modern America really looks like through their eyes.

Told from the point of view of the children themselves, this one-hour documentary offers a unique perspective on the nation's flagging economy and the impact of unemployment, homelessness, and poverty.

Three single princesses from around the world come to the UK to find Prince Charming to take back to their kingdom. To ensure the people they meet love them for themselves and not just their title, the Princesses go undercover as everyday girls, living together in a house in Essex.

Her Royal Highness Princess Xenia of Saxony is a descendant of one of the most powerful royal families Europe has ever known. At 22, she is a well-known celebrity in Germany, but a combination of her beauty, fame and royalty has made it difficult for her to find true love.

Her Highness Princess Aaliya of Balasinor's ancestors were ancient warriors who ruled in western India for centuries. The 35-year-old Princess has had a traditional and sheltered upbringing within a family where marriages are usually arranged. She has never been on a date before, and never had a boyfriend.

Princess Nvannungi Sheillah is from Buganda, the largest and most powerful kingdom in Uganda, presiding over five and a half million subjects. The princess is one of the most famous women in her country and has a career as a pop star.

Three bachelor princes from across the globe come to the UK in search of true love. However, to ensure that the people they meet will love them for themselves and not just their wealth and status they are going undercover, living and working as ordinary people for the first time in their lives.

The three princes must share a terraced house in Brighton without their trusty servants and must try to cope on their own, as well as taking an 'ordinary' job. They also hit the singles scene as they trawl the bars and clubs, join internet dating sites and even try their hand at speed dating in their bid to find a partner amongst 'commoners'.

Crown Prince Manvendra is from one of India's richest royal families and, in 2006, he shocked the world by becoming the first Indian royal to come out as gay. Will Brighton prove the perfect place for him to find his lifelong partner?

His Royal Highness Prince Africa Zulu is from Zululand, South Africa. At 30, he should now have taken a wife, but having been burnt by love before it will take him a while to find his Mrs Right. How will this traditional prince cope with the liberal Brighton culture?

His Royal Highness Prince Remigius of Jaffna, Sri Lanka is looking for a queen to continue the royal line. But for a man raised in accordance to a strict protocol, only an aristocrat will do.

This documentary is an engaging look at the legacy of charity, goodwill and kindness left by the world's most beloved Princess. Diana, Princess of Wales was so much more than just a member of the British Royal family. Through her charity work, she gave hope to the homeless, care to the sick and those injured by landmines, and a loving touch to AIDS sufferers. Her legacy lives on in her two sons, William and Harry, who have continued in their mother's footsteps, helping the charities closest to her heart. Her positive influence can be seen in the boys as they grow into men, becoming confident, responsible and well-thought of in their chosen field — the military.

Their son Edward decides that the only option is to turn Burton Court into an upmarket wedding and function venue. With most of the family savings sunk into the project, can Edward make it succeed?

Caligula has now become known as Rome's most capricious tyrant, and the stories told about him are some of the most extraordinary told about any Roman emperor. He was said to have made his horse a consul, proclaimed himself a living God, and indulged in scandalous orgies - even with his own three sisters - and that's before you mention building vast bridges across land and sea, prostituting senators' wives and killing half the Roman elite seemingly on a whim. All that in just four short years in power before a violent and speedy assassination in a back alley of his own palace at just 29 years old.

We take a journey into the adrenaline-fuelled world of this sometimes fatal activity and meet the people who take part.
-
This documentary shows a completely different side of this high adrenalin extreme activity. It zooms in on the individuals inside the birdman suits and reveals how their flying has forever changed them and altered their views on life and death. We follow a group of wingsuiters in South Africa at different stages of their wingsuiting careers, shortly after the country’s first wingsuit fatality. They speak with uncanny frankness about their reasons for being wingsuiters, the almost supernatural thrill of being able to fly like a bird, but also about the unique sacrifices the sport requires.

Featuring breathtaking visual imagery filmed in African, European and American skies, “The Birdmen Chronicles” tells a poignant story of human striving and sacrifice, and is sure to turn popular conceptions about birdmen and -women completely upside down.

It involved burrowing through some of the hardest rock in the world, firming up risky sink-hole terrain and building of massive superstructures that have changed the face of Johannesburg and Pretoria. But questions remain whether the Gautrain will solve the transport problems of South Africa's economic heartland..... where the car is still king!

The sheer scale of this massive engineering feat, completed in the midst of the daily bustle of two of South Africa's largest cities, has been hard to imagine.  It involved burrowing through some of the hardest rock in the world, firming up risky sink-hole terrain and building of massive superstructures that have changed the face of Johannesburg and Pretoria. But questions remain whether the Gautrain will solve the transport problems of South Africa's economic heartland..... where the car is still king!

The vintage aircraft needs to be restored before it can fly again and so must travel by truck halfway across England. Too large to be moved in one piece, this film follows the team attempt to dismantle the Canberra into many pieces for its treacherous road trip. 

The job proves to be a huge challenge, as the aircraft must remain airworthy after it has been re-assembled. To fit the bomber onto a convoy of trucks, the team must disconnect the fuselage, wings and tail. They must build a support cradle for each component so they don’t knock or roll about on route while also being able to squeeze through narrow roads and low obstacles on the way. The journey is fraught with problems from rainstorms to traffic-jammed roads. Following a painstaking reconstruction process in Newquay, will this classic aircraft survive the journey to fly again?

Wim Jelsma and Carin Koning is a couple on a mission to build and move their ultimate dream home - one of seven floating mansions that will become a new waterborne community in the Netherlands.  This film follows a team of engineers build and move the aquatic homes across 70 miles of treacherous Dutch waterways and through a mile of narrow country roads. Before they can set sail, they first need to be built. Great care must go into pouring the large concrete foundations as a single crack or imperfection could sink them before they get chance to float. Only after the luxurious upper floors are attached to the foundations, can they then call on the experience of tug boat captain, Peter Bokschoten.

Captain Peter has the responsibility of towing all seven properties across the Netherlands; dodging dangerous ice flows and avoiding titanic tanker collisions.  His final challenge is to guide them all into precarious-looking crane slings – where they will be hoisted onto trucks for a mile of cross country hauling, before being craned into their idyllic lake destination.  Will Wim and Carin's dream home make it to the lake without being smashed, sunk or lost out to sea?

Super-size missions, risky routes, and the biggest cargo on the planet-imagine hauling a submarine over dry land, transporting a fleet of mega-yachts across the Atlantic, or relocating 20 ancient Egyptian temples...and now meet the heavy hauliers who tackle incredible odds to get the job done.

The A4 Pacific locomotive smashed the rail world speed record in 1938, thundering to over 126 miles an hour. To celebrate this record’s 75th anniversary the museum is shipping all the surviving A4 Pacific’s to the UK for display. 

For specialist train trucker Andrew Goodman and his crew, this transatlantic train trek is their toughest challenge yet. The locomotives are no longer able to run under their own steam and need loading onto freight trains where there’s the constant risk these massive but fragile machines could disintegrate. Will the team haul the engines to the docks in time to load them onto their ship back to Britain?

Even accounting for the plastic that washes up on beaches or is trapped in arctic ice, millions of tonnes have simply disappeared.

As most plastic never deteriorates, it simply breaks down into smaller and smaller particles that are invisible to the human eye, what happens to this missing ocean plastic is a mystery. In this investigation, scientists embark in search of micro-plastics. Small, mostly invisible, toxic, they are home to a new ecosystem: the plastisphere. But where are they? Ingested by organisms? Buried under the ocean floor? Degraded by bacteria? And what is the impact of them entering the food chain?

Although they have one of the most dissected marriages in America, Bill and Hillary Clinton have kept their marriage together in spite of rough times, complicated and busy schedules, and lack of privacy. While Hillary Rodham Clinton’s activism as First Lady resulted in probably the highest public profile ever accorded a presidential spouse, the Clinton’s were deeply protective of the priva- cy of their only child, Chelsea. Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980, and spent her entire childhood as the daughter of two very active and politically driven public figures. Driven begins with the Bill and Hillary story with their first meeting in the Yale Law School library in a fabled and maybe even true story of how Hillary accosted Bill who was so smitten he couldn’t remember his own name. We track family life, examine their political careers and explore the highs, lows and challenges that this polarizing family has endured along the way.
